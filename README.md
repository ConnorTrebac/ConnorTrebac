- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @ConnorTrebac, I grew up in the NW suburbs of Chicago and went to Lake Zurich high school which is probably somewhat familiar to most of you
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in skiiing, college sports in general, and I think planes are just swell. I go to Colorado and visit family every year so getting away to the mountains is my favorite passtime
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently majoring in Aerospace with a minor in NDE
